						It has been an absolute pleasure to be taught by Linda for 12 years since I was 6 years old, from learning to putting on a shoulder rest to currently working towards the ARSM diploma this summer. She has both an immense technical knowledge of the violin and a deep understanding of musicality and different genres of music. Her enthusiasm is apparent through her lessons and encouragement for her students to participate in all sorts of musical opportunities such as joining local orchestras, playing ensemble music with her students and taking part in competitions. Lessons are particularly engaging due to both her dedication to playing to the strengths of individual pupils and the back-and-forth aspect of our musical discussions.

						Linda taught me violin for ten years and I could not have asked for a more patient and professional teacher. Linda made lessons fun and engaging, while focusing on technique and sound. She enhanced my playing experience by encouraging me to join the Hampshire County Youth Orchestra and other local orchestras and was always incredibly supportive and encouraging. I will always be grateful to Linda for being such a fantastic teacher and friend.

						I have been learning wìth Linda for just over a year now and I have felt my playing ability increase dramatically in that time. She is very knowledgable on playing both the violin and viola, and there hasn't been an issue I've brought up with her that we have been unable to fix. I cannot recommend her highly enough as a teacher.

						I have known Linda Crisp since her student days when she had violin lessons with me at the Colchester Institute. Her passion and enthusiasm for the violin was clear to me from the outset, and she has built a professional career based on her violinistic talent and her dedication and total commitment to music and to the instrument.
						Linda is not only a player of distinction but also a gifted teacher of both violin and viola. Her main philosophy is firstly to the music, providing the student with the understanding of the style and the meaning of the music, then giving them the technical equipment with which to achieve 			these musical concepts. Linda has a most friendly and enthusiastic personality, she enjoys building a relationship with her students, assuring that the musical experience is always positive and enduring.
						She has extensive knowledge of violinistic techniques, and has access to a very wide range of repertoire to suit all levels and ages of students from beginners to Conservatoire entrance. She also coaches chamber ensembles, and enjoys working with amateur players and groups. 
						Linda Crisp is a very valuable member of the teaching community.
