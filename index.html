					<p>Listen to a really good violinist or viola player and you should be struck by the beautiful expressive sound they produce. This sound doesn't come solely through lots of practice, it also comes from excellent technique.</p><br>

I have a wealth of experience helping parents and students to buy good violins and violas and also to have knowledge of how to maintain them. I have sourced grants for students towards instrument purchase and can also help you find hired instruments, well set up, of good value and originally purchased from Geoff Denyer, a renowned violin maker and restorer. Hiring an instrument can be a great way to get started.</p>

					<h2>Linda Crisp</h2>
					<p>Hi, my name is Linda Crisp, Grad dip mus, LTCL(T), FISM. I am an enhanced DBS certified violin and viola teacher, working from my home in Dibden Purlieu, near Hythe on the Waterside, an area nestled between the New Forest and Southampton Water in Hampshire. I have taught students from as far and wide as Romsey, Winchester, Basingstoke, Sway, Milford on Sea, Brockenhurst, Lymington, Dibden Purlieu, Hythe, Holbury, Langley, Blackfield, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Australia!</p>

				<p id="music-education">I base all my teaching on the wonderful teaching I received from <a href="https://www.ram.ac.uk/people/diana-cummings" target="__blank">Diana Cummings</a>, <span>FRAM</span>. I started my main musical education at Colchester Institute graduating with a Grad dip Mus in 1984. During the 3 years there I did performance, conducted a youth string orchestra, and taught violin and viola. While there I started my lessons with Diana Cummings and continued in london for the next 2 years gaining my LTCL(T) diploma as an external student of Trinity college of Music in 1985. </p>
				<p id="early-teaching">After completing my studies at Trinity I moved back to Hampshire and started teaching privately at home and freelance in private schools. During this time I also taught for Hampshire Music Service and became a Hampshire Award student teacher. I became a string coach for Waterside Area Orchestras working closely with the conductors to encourage and develop the players in an orchestral environment.</p>
				<p>For 18 years I worked at several schools in Lymington teaching violin and viola. I've had many students achieve their grade 8, move on to their diplomas and also play in the Hampshire County Youth Orchestra. A student I taught from when she was 6 has gained a place at The Royal Academy of Music, Trinity Laban and Birmingham Conservatoire to study viola. I also have many students playing in university and amateur orchestras.</p>
				<p id="teaching-at-home">I now only work at home, teaching violin and viola with students currently ranging from ages 5 to 72 and standards from beginner to diploma and music college entry. I also teach beginner piano to grade 5 with theory. My students have a very high rate of achievement at distinction in ABRSM exams but I don't insist on doing lots of exams, some of my students have only ever done Grade 8! It is totally the student's choice. Lessons are student led, with scales, studies and pieces every week. I also teach theory and aural. We do lots of duets, trios and quartets, and I arrange other chamber music sessions with larger groups for which I provide coaching. Former students also come back and join current students to play chamber music, playing such pieces as Dvorak's wonderful Terzetto for 2 violins and viola and Arvo Part's 'Summa'.
